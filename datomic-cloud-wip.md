I am using Datomic Cloud and am trying to compile my code before deployment -- to catch any errors without incurring AWS costs. I am using @seancorfieldâ€™s excellent depstar but I don't have a -main since I am deploying Ions. Can anyone advise me how to do the compilation? thanks!

@hadils Do Ions not have a standard entry point?

No, the entry point is in Datomic Cloud...

Yeah, but how does it know what to call in your Ion code?

The general answer here is:
1. create a classes folder
2. add it to your :paths in deps.edn
3. run clojure -e "(compile,'your.namespace)" to compile stuff
4. run depstar so it will JAR up the source and the classes

Or if you only care about putting the source in the JAR, but want to do the compile as a sanity check, add a :compile alias that has :main-opts ["-e" "(compile,'your.namespace)"] and then clojure -A:compile and don't both putting "classes" in your :paths -- you still need the folder for compile to compile into.
