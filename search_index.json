Webapps, Practical.li\n\nThis is an introduce to developing server-side web applications using the Clojure programming language.  The aim is to present Clojure in a simple to understand and highly practical way for developers of any of experience.\n  This workshop guides you through the basics of server-side web development and helps you understand the modular approach to using Clojure effectively.  Along the way the relevant functions and design approaches common in Clojure will be highlighted.\nRequirements\nYou will need the following in order to complete this workshop.  The setup contains details on how to get your environment ready\n\nA working Java runtime environment (JRE) - test with java -version in a command line window\nLeiningen - test with lein version in a command line window\nA Clojure aware editor with REPL\nLightTable\nEmacs with either Spacemacs or CIDER\n\n\nA Git client (optional)\nA free Heroku account for running Postgres database (alternatively install Posgtres database on your laptop)\n\nCode for the workshop\nThe code for this workshop is contained in the Github repository Clojure Webapps example, the code for each section is in a specific branch.\nTo get a copy of the repository, use the following git clone command which creates a new directory called clojure-webapps-example that contains the cloned code.\ngit clone https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-webapps-example.git\nOnce you have the repository, use git checkout branch-name to get the code for each section.  Each branch is a working application with all the features covered in that section\nUse git branch to show all the branches available, they should match the names of the sections in this workshop.\nEnjoy.\nAdditional Resources\nHere are some resources outside of this workshop that can help you learn more about Clojure\nGetting Started\n\nGetting started with Clojure - a general guide to Clojure (work in progress)\nClojure through code - many examples of basic Clojure code\n4Clojure exercises &amp; 4Clojure Google group\nLighttable Koans - exercises to help you discover Clojure\nGetting started with Clojure on Heroku\n\nClojure\n\nClojure.org, features and rational\nClojure documentation\nClojure cheetsheet\nOfficial Google group\nCrossClj - cross-referencing the Clojure ecosystem\n\nTooling\n\nLeiningen, tutorial, faq, plugins list &amp; sample project file\nSpacemacs\nLightTable, docs, blog, announcements and discussions.\n\nCommunity\n\nClojure-docs - community docs\nCrossCLJ - cross-referencing the Clojure ecosystem\nLondon Clojurians and their Google group\nUncle Bob presents Clojure\n\nBooks &amp; Tutorials\n\nLiving Clojure\nClojure cookbook\nBrave Clojure - a Clojure tutorial using Emacs\n\nWeb Frameworks (templates)\n\nluminus - a leingingen template based on Ring &amp; Compojure, with many options\nduct - simple, minimal production-grade framework\npedestal-service - an opinionated, extensible &amp; scalable framework\nJUXT Edge - a tool for creating and updating projects.\n\nDatabase\n\nTesting databases faster - using rollbacks\n\n\nPracticalli, Clojure WebApps by John Stevenson is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.Based on a work at practical.li.\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"overview/":{"url":"overview/","title":"Theory: Clojure Overview","body":"Clojure Overview\n I love Clojure because its powerful, flexible and fun.\nClojure is\n\na general purpose language that compiles code that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).\na functional programming language with a data centric approach (mostly pure)\na very small syntax (12 primitives, 4 of which were added for Java interoperability)\na dynamically &amp; strongly typed with type inference, keeping the language simple\na fast-feedback approach for development, helping you quickly explore a problem domain\na modern implementation of LISP\na highly extensible language via macros\nan efficient way to manage state changes via persistent data structures &amp; software transactional memory\n\n Avoiding state changesIn functional programming we avoid changing state as much as possible.If a function does not change state it is referentially transparent, always returning the same result when given the same input (arguments).  These are refered to as Pure Functions.  Pure functions are highly modular as they do not affect any other part of the system and do not require complex threading for scalability.\nClojureScript\nClojureScript is Clojure that compiles to to JavaScript and runs in the browser (JavaScript Engine).  Most of the code and libraries available for Clojure works seamlessly when compiled to JavaScript.\nClojureScript is based heavily on the work done for Google Closures and there is a strong focus on Reactive client side apps.\nThere is a common file extension, .cljc that signifies Clojure code that is written to run on the JVM and JavaScript engines.\nClojure Community\nThere is a vibrant and highly active community around Clojure.  In London alone there is a regular monthly talk and 4 coding dojo every month.\nCommunity resources\nClojure. tv and Planet Clojure are the tip of the iceburg to a large amount of Clojure resources available via the Internet.\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"overview/webapps-in-clojure.html":{"url":"overview/webapps-in-clojure.html","title":"Theory: WebApps in Clojure","body":"Web Apps in Clojure Overview\n  A typical Web application receives data, does something with it and return a result.  This is the essence of how a function works in Clojure.  So again, its really simple to build web apps with.\n  As Clojure is centered around dynamically typed &amp; immutable data structures, it makes web applications really easy to build and simple to scale through parallelism.  As most of your application will be stateless, it is less complex and less prone to conflicts.\nLibraries over frameworks\n  Clojure also takes a very modular approach to building any application and has many great libraries to minimise the work involved.  As Java Interoperability is also very easy in Clojure, its trivial to use Java libraries too.\n  Web apps in Clojure are typically built from a collection of highly focused libraries, that complement each others functions.  Talking a modular approach, you can swap components &amp; libraries easily should there be value in a different approach.  Common libraries for web app development include:\n\nRing - a web application library\nCompojure - an simple way to define routes for your ring webapp\nHiccup or [Selma]- write html in Clojure\nKorma, YesQL, hugSql - database abstraction layers\nclojure.java.jdbc or clojure.jdbc - low level SQL libraries\nPrismatic Schema - database schema mapping\nMigratus - database migrations (and all the things)\n\nThe closed thing to a framework in Clojure is Pedistal.  Frameworks constrain you to a certain approach to building apps and if you can live inside these constraints they can be very powerful.\nProject templates\n  You don&#39;t have to build projects from scratch each time, although this is a valid approach.  There are many great Clojure project templates available via the build automation tool, Leiningen\nProject templates are used as follows\nlein new template-name project-name\nThere are many great templates to try that provide insight into building webapps in Clojure.\n\ncompojure - a simple project with routing\nluminus - a production ready app template\nduct - simple, minimal production-grade framework\npedestal-service - an opinionated, extensible &amp; scalable framework\n\nYou can find a range of project templates by searching for lein-template on Clojars.org.  There is also a guide to writing templates on Leiningen.org\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"setup/":{"url":"setup/","title":"Setup","body":"Setup\n  This workshop requires Leiningen to create, manage and run projects.  Any text editor is fine, preferably with Clojure syntax support.  You also need Java runtime environment, preferably version 1.8 or greater.\nJava\n  Check you have a Java runtime on your system path by typing the following in a terminal window:\njava -version\n\nIf Java is not found, please install it from Oracle or OpenJDK.  Java may also be available via your operating systems package manger, for example on Ubuntu / Debian systems this would be installed via sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre\nLeiningen\n  Leiningen is the most commonly used build automation tool used to manage Clojure projects.  Install by saving the Leiningen install script and running it inside a terminal window\n\nInstall script for Linux &amp; MacOSX\nInstall script for Microsoft Windows\n\nSave the file to somewhere on your operating system path, eg ~/bin\nchmod a+x ~/bin/lein\nlein\n\n The first time you run this script it downloads a Java archive file (JAR) of the latest version of Leiningen.  When you run the script again, you have a working Leiningen build tool.\nDevelopment tools with Clojure support\nA tool that understands Clojure will help you write code faster and more accurately.  Here are a few common development tools used for Clojure\n\nLightTable - has an Instarepl that evaluates your code as you type, great for Clojure beginners\nEmacs  with either Emacs Live, Spacemacs or CIDER -  highly extensible support for Clojure, auto-completion, snippets, REPL &amp; refactoring.\nNightcode - good for beginers, nice Clojure on Android support\nSublimeText - simple editor with basic Clojure awareness, used with lein repl on the command line\n\nClojure\nThere is no specific install for Clojure.  Clojure comes as a library, a JAR file, managed by the build tool Leiningen just like any other dependency.\nWhen you create a project with Leiningen, the configuration is created in a file called project.clj.  Inside this project.clj is a :dependencies entry where the version of clojure is specified along with any other dependencies.  Here is an example of a project.clj configuration with just Clojure as a dependency\n(defproject project-name &quot;0.1.0-SNAPSHOT&quot;\n  :description &quot;FIXME: write description&quot;\n  :url &quot;http://example.com/FIXME&quot;\n  :license {:name &quot;Eclipse Public License&quot;\n            :url &quot;http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html&quot;}\n  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure &quot;1.8.0&quot;]])\n  The Clojure library is very small (~3.6Mb) and Leiningen caches it and all other libraries locally in the same folder structure that Maven uses, eg Clojure version 1.8.0 would be cached in ~/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.8.0/\nHeroku Postgres\nThe web application will also use a database to persist state.  For this project we are using the Postgres relational database, an open source and well maintained project with all the features of a modern database you would expect.\nTo save on installation, we will use Heroku Posgres, a database on demand service that has a free tier for development.\nTo start with, create a free account on Heroku.  The step to create a database will be covered later on in the workshop.\n  Alternatively, you can install Posgres database locally on your laptop, however assistance with this is not provided.\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"create-a-project/":{"url":"create-a-project/","title":"Create a Project","body":"Create a project\n  Lets create a project called todo-list using Leiningen, the build automation tool for Clojure.

A namespace limits the scope of functions and names of data structures to a specific namespace.\n  The names used with defn or defn- to define a function can be used anywhere (see hint) in the namespace just by that name.  The same goes for any values defined by def.\n  To use a function outside the namespace, you need to use its namespace and its name, for example clojure.string/reverse\n  Remember that Clojure is evaluated from top to bottom, so if you are calling a named function or data structure, it must have had its definition evaluated first.\nInclude another namespace in the REPL\n  The require function will provide access functions and names from specific namespaces and an alias for the namespace can also be specified with the :as directive.\n  A function from that namespace can then be used by prefixing its name with the alias specified in the require expression.\n  Here is an example of including the clojure.string namespace and calling its reverse fuction\n(require &apos;[clojure.string :as string])\n\n(string/reverse &quot;RedRum&quot;)\nIncluding another namespace in source code\n  Instead of the require function, add the :require keyword in the namespace definition, ns.\n(ns todo-list.core\n (:require &apos;[clojure.string :as string))\n\n(string/reverse &quot;RedRum&quot;)\n  If a funciton will be used many times in the namespace, you can :refer a function so you can call it just by name, as if it had been defined in the current namespace.\n(ns todo-list.core\n (:require &apos;[clojure.string :refer [reverse]))\n\n(reverse &quot;RedRum&quot;)\n  If you are using most functions from another namespace, you could :refer :all.  However, use this sparingly as it could lead to functions over-riding each other.\n(ns todo-list.core\n (:require &apos;[clojure.string :refer :all))\n  You may see use or :use in earlier Clojure code.  Although this still works, it includes everything from the other namespace into your current one.  This is seen as a bad practice, especially when writing libraries, as you can end up including a great many unused functions into the namespace.As Clojure is typically composed of many libraries, its prudent to only include the specific things you need from another namespace.  This also helps reduce conflicts when including multiple libraries in your project.\nNamespaces outside the project\n  To use a namespace from a library that is not part of the project, you also need to include it as a dependency.

However you do not need to specify any specific types as Clojure simply infers the type and handles most type collision gracefully.  The built in collections (list, map, vector &amp; set) also support mixed types too.\nIn our project we are using Jetty, a web application server written in Java.  As its Java it needs a specific type of object passed as an argument for the port number, in this case an Integer.  However, when we run the Clojure project, the argument we supply for the port number on the command line is treated as a String object.  Therefore we need to change the port number from a Java String type to an Java Integer type.\nThe java.lang. library is part of all Clojure projects, so as we are going to create a Java Integer it makes sense to simply use the Integer constructor with a String argument which returns a new Integer object.\nThe Integer. port-number Clojure code is a short-hand for calling the java.lang.Integer constructor.  The . is actually a macro in Clojure that provides a simple way to work with Java, allowing you to call Java objects as if they were Clojure functions.  In Java you would have to use the form Type instance-name = new Type(argument).  In our example you would write this in Java as String port = new String(port-number)\n   From the Java 8 docs for Integer class:Integer(String s) - constructs a newly allocated Integer object that represents the int value indicated by the String parameter.\nTheory: Its Java Objects underneath strings &amp; numbers\nStrings and numbers are represented by Java objects underneath, so its convienient to use Java Classes to manipulate these simple data structures on the rare occasion you need a specific type.\nYou can see the underlying Java types in Clojure using the type or class function.

Ring then converts this to a Clojure map called request.  All handlers in our application take a request map as an argument.\nA map in Clojure contains one or more key / value pairs, you may be familiar with the term hash map.  The keys in these maps are often defined using a Clojure keyword.  A keyword is a symbol that points to itself and so therefore is unique within a specific scope.  A keyword makes it very easy to get a value from a map and acts as a function on the map to return its associated value\nSo, assume we have defined a map called request.

We can get the value associated with the key using the keyword as a function\n(def request {:uri &quot;/&quot;})\n\n(:uri request)\n\n;; As a map can also act as a function to get its elements, you can also use the following form to get the same value\n(request :uri)\n\nThe function get is functions that helps us get data from maps.

Any key must be unique within the scope of a map.\nThe following maps will throw duplicate key errors\n{&quot;fish&quot; &quot;battered&quot; &quot;chips&quot; &quot;fried&quot; &quot;fish&quot; &quot;battered and fried&quot;}\n{:fish &quot;battered&quot; :chips &quot;fried&quot; :fish &quot;battered &amp; fried&quot;}\nDuplicate values are okay though\n{&quot;fish&quot; &quot;battered&quot; &quot;chips&quot; &quot;fried&quot; &quot;cod&quot; &quot;fried&quot;}\nThe same key can be used in a nested map.  For example, if a map has a keyword of :name and that key has a value defined by a map, then that map can also use the key :name.\n{:name {:name &quot;john&quot; :address &quot;London&quot;}}\nChanging Maps\nMaps are immutable, however you can \n(def alphabet-soup {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3})\n\n(assoc alphabet-soup :d 4)\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"persistent-data-structures/vectors.html":{"url":"persistent-data-structures/vectors.html","title":"Theory: Vectors","body":"Theory: Vectors\nClojure Vectors can be though of as array collections.

The defroutes macro provides a simple syntax for defining routes and associating handler functions.\nWhat is a macro\nClojure has a programmatic macro system which allows the Clojure community to extend the language, rather than wait for the language designers.  This macro approach also helps keep the language very compact, with a minimum of primatives. \nWe have already used several macros in our code.  In our project.clj configuration we use the defproject macro to make it easy to define our Clojure project.  In our code we have used the defn macro to define names (symbols) for functions.\nPeeking under the covers\nYou can always look at what a macro is doing by using the macroexpand or macroexpand-all functions.  These functions show you what the code looks like after the macro-reader has processed the macro. \nTo expand a macro, require the clojure.walk library in your namespace\n[clojure.walk :as walk]\n\nThen wrap the macro you wish to explore with the macroexpand-all function.\n(walk/macroexpand-all \n &#39;(defroutes myapp\n    (GET &quot;/&quot; [] &quot;Show something&quot;)))\n\n\n(def myapp\n  (compojure.core/routes\n   (compojure.core/make-route\n    :get #clout.core.CompiledRoute{:source &quot;/&quot;, :re #&quot;/&quot;, :keys [], :absolute? false}\n    (fn* ([request__13075__auto__] (let* [] &quot;Show something&quot;))))))\n\nYou can see that the defroutes function expands to a make-route function that creates the details of the route and associates it with a handler or response map.The routes function join multiple routes together.\nFor further examples, see http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/clojure-macros/\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"compojure/using-compojure.html":{"url":"compojure/using-compojure.html","title":"Using Compojure","body":"Using Compojure in the project\nLets add a defroute function to define routes and their associated handlers.\n\nAdd Compojure to the namespace\n  Add the defroutes function, GET protocol and notfound route from Compojure to the namespace\n(ns todo-list.core\n  (:require [ring.adapter.jetty :as jetty]\n            [ring.middleware.reload :refer [wrap-reload]]\n            [compojure.core :refer [defroutes GET]]\n            [compojure.route :refer [not-found]]))\n\nRefactor the welcome function to just say Hello\n  The welcome function should just do one simple thing, return a welcome message.\n(defn welcome\n  &quot;A ring handler to respond with a simple welcome message&quot;\n  [request]\n  {:status 200\n     :body &quot;&lt;h1&gt;Hello, Clojure World&lt;/h1&gt;\n     &lt;p&gt;Welcome to your first Clojure app, I now update automatically&lt;/p&gt;&quot;\n     &lt;p&gt;I now use defroutes to manage incoming requests&lt;/p&gt;\n   :headers {}})\n\nAdd a defroutes function\n  Add a defroutes function called app to manage our routes.

For example, you can add your name to the end of the web address and the returned web page will include your name.\n  By adding an element to the route path, we can take that element from the URL as it is part of the request.  We can then get that value from the request map and use it in our body content.\n   Create a simple personalised hello message by adding a route for /hello with /:name as a path element.Create a hello function as the handler that pulls out the :name element from the request and adds it to the response.\n(defn hello\n  &quot;A simple personalised greeting showing the use of variable path elements&quot;\n  [request]\n  (let [name (get-in request [:route-params :name])]\n    {:status 200\n     :body (str &quot;Hello &quot; name &quot;.

The name and value are immutable.\n(let [name value])\n\nIn our example we are pulling out a value from a map and using the let function to create a name we can use to reference that value.  The name is used to in the body of the response map, so when the response map is returned the page is displayed with the name.\n(let [name (get-in request [:route-params :name])]\n    {:status 200\n     :body (str &quot;Hello &quot; name &quot;.  I got your name from the web URL&quot;)\n     :headers {}})\n\nThe Ring adaptor creates a map from the browser request, this is called the request map.  This request map is passed to the handler function.\nTheory: Accessing Maps\nThe request is a Clojure map made up of keys and values.  The keys are Clojure keywords.  Some of the values in a map are also represented as maps\nHere is an example of a request map\n{:request-params {:name &quot;John&quot;}}\n\nUsing the get function we can pull out the value for a particular keyword in the map\n(get map :keyword)\n\nYou can use get with a nested map, however you would need a nested get funciton call\n(get (get outer-map :outer-keyword) :inner-keyword)\n\nWith many nested maps, the get function can lead to code that is harder to read.  Using the get-in function provides a simpler syntax for traversing nested maps\n(get-in map [:outer-keyword :inner-keyword]\n\nTheory: Using keywords and maps\nYou can also use keywords to extract values from maps when using the keywords as the keys\n(def response-map {:name &quot;john&quot; :path &quot;/helo&quot;}\n\nYou can get the value from this map using the keywork\n(response-map :name)\n\n=&gt; &quot;john&quot;\n\n(response-map :path)\n\n=&gt; &quot;/hello&quot;\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"compojure/lisp-calculator.html":{"url":"compojure/lisp-calculator.html","title":"Lisp Calculator","body":"Simple Calculator\n  Lets create a very simple lisp based calculator that works with two numbers as another example of using variable path elements.

One JVM is to run Leiningen and the second JVM is to run your application.  By using Leiningen to run your application in production you are using use extra resources and also risk pulling in unnecessary development libraries &amp; configurationonly needed during development.\nWhen you run your application in production you can save resources by only running a JVM for your application.  This is done by running a Clojure application just like a Java application, using the java command in the Heroku Procfile.\nTheory: Building Clojure\nBuilding a Clojure project with Leiningen generates a Java jar file, a packaged version of your application.  A jar file generated from Java can be run using java -jar jar-file-name.jar.  However to run your Clojure jar file as a Java application you also need to include the the Clojure core library.\nLeiningen can also generate an Uberjar.  The uberjar is a jar file that also includes the Clojure library as well as your application and libraries.  As the uberjar contains Clojure, you can run an uberjar in any Java environment.\nBy adding an :uberjar entry to the project.clj then the Leiningen command lein uberjar is run during the build and an uberjar is created.\nWhen deploying on Heroku your application is built from your codebase using Leiningen, pulling in all the libraries your application depends on.  When your application is run it is done so as a Java application using the uberjarjust, starting just the one JVM.\nFurther reading: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/clojure-support\nTheory: Identifying an entry point for your application\nIf your main namespace doesn&#x2019;t have a :gen-class then you can use clojure.main as your entry point and indicate your app&#x2019;s main namespace using the -m argument in your Procfile:\nweb: java $JVM_OPTS -cp target/myproject-standalone.jar clojure.main -m myproject.web\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"heroku/deploy.html":{"url":"heroku/deploy.html","title":"Deploy to Heroku","body":"Deploy to Heroku\nFirst we need to create an Heroku app to deploy our Clojure webapp to.

So the same heading in Hiccup would be written as:\n[:h1 {:class &quot;heading&quot;} &quot;I am a heading&quot;]\n\nUsing Hiccup\nAdd the hiccup dependency to your project.clj file\n[hiccup &quot;1.0.5&quot;]\nIn the REPL, require the hiccup.core library\nuser=&gt; (require &apos;[hiccup.core :as markup])\n;; =&gt; nil\n\nOr add hiccup to the namespace definition in your Clojure code file.\n(ns my-namespace.core\n  (require &apos;[hiccup.core :as markup]))\n\nWriting Hiccup\nHere is a basic example of Hiccup syntax:\n(markup/html [:span {:class &quot;foo&quot;} &quot;bar&quot;])\n;; =&gt; &quot;&lt;span class=\\&quot;foo\\&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&quot;\n\nThe first element of the vector is used as the element name. The second attribute can optionally be a map, in which case it is used to supply the element&apos;s attributes. Every other element is considered part of the tag&apos;s body.\nHiccup is intelligent enough to render different HTML elements in different ways, in order to accommodate browser quirks:\n(markup/html [:script])\n;; =&gt; &quot;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&quot;\n\n(html [:p])\n;; =&gt;  &quot;&lt;p /&gt;&quot;\n\nAnd provides a CSS-like shortcut for denoting id and class attributes:\n(markup/html [:div#foo.bar.baz &quot;bang&quot;])\n;; =&gt;  &quot;&lt;div id=\\&quot;foo\\&quot; class=\\&quot;bar baz\\&quot;&gt;bang&lt;/div&gt;&quot;\n\nWhen writing multiple lines of hiccup markup, wrap them in either a [:div ] or a (list ) expression.\n[:div\n  [:h1 &quot;My Picture Album&quot;]\n  [:img {:src seaside.png} &quot;A sunny seaside view&quot;]\n  [:img {:src pier.png} &quot;A walk along the pier&quot;]]\n\nIf the body of the element is a seq, its contents will be expanded out into the element body. This makes working with forms like map and for more convenient:\n(html [:ul\n  (for [x (range 1 4)]\n    [:li x])])\n;; =&gt; &quot;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&quot;\n\n(html\n  [:ul\n  (for [x (range 1 4)]\n    [:li x])])\n;; =&gt; &quot;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&quot;\n\nThe parent tag will still be rendered in the above example, so\n  Hiccup reference and guides\nHiccup API\nHiccup Tips - Lisp Cast\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"hiccup/updating-handlers-with-hiccup.html":{"url":"hiccup/updating-handlers-with-hiccup.html","title":"Updating handlers with hiccup","body":"Updating handlers with hiccup\nInstead of including fiddly html code (and having to make sure you close tags), we will write our markup in Clojure syntax using hiccup.\nAdd dependencies\n  Add hiccup dependencies\n[hiccup &quot;1.0.5&quot;]\n\nRequire hiccup\n  Add hiccup to your namespace\n[hiccup.core :refer :all]\n[hiccup.page :refer :all]\n\nYour core.clj file should look like this\n(ns todo-list.core\n  (:require [ring.adapter.jetty :as jetty]\n            [ring.middleware.reload :refer [wrap-reload]]\n            [compojure.core :refer [defroutes GET]]\n            [compojure.route :refer [not-found]]\n            [ring.handler.dump :refer [handle-dump]]\n            [hiccup.core :refer :all]\n            [hiccup.page :refer :all]))\n\nUpdate the welcome handler\n  Change the welcome handler to use hiccup rather than html code\n(defn welcome\n  &quot;A ring handler to respond with a simple welcome message&quot;\n  [request]\n  (html [:h1 &quot;Hello, Clojure World&quot;]\n        [:p &quot;Welcome to your first Clojure app, I now update automatically&quot;]))\n\nThe html function create html code based on the keywords used.

Say you have 3 functions f1,f2,f3, then you can refer to them in these ways:\n(require [interview.prompts.rawlist :refer [f1 f2] :as r)\n(f1)\n(f2)\n(r/f3)\nNotice in third case, because it wasn&#39;t in the refer list, you have to use the r prefix.\nFor test folders, read the documentation for leiningen where it is explained, but basically boils down to:\n+ /interview\n|--+ src/\n|--+ test/\nand the sub-folder structure follows exactly the same pattern as the src dir.\nYou can add additional folders in project.clj using :source-paths and :test-paths keys in the main project macro. See the sample project for more information.\nI recommend you absorb everything in the sample project above, and also read the leiningen tutorial.\nFinally, when referring to functions in the ns declaration in other sources (e.g. in your tests) you use the same format, but using the :require form:\n(ns foo.bar\n  (:require [interview.prompts.rawlist :as r]))\n\n(r/foo-fn)\n\nElaborated from a stack exchange answer on the use of namespaces by Mark Fisher\n\nUsing Libraries\nThe use function also makes another libraries namespace accessible to the current one.  However use includes everything from the other library, it also makes everything part of the same namespace (ie. as if the functions, macros, name bindngs, etc were written in your library).\nTherefore the use function is usually avoided and require is used instead.  However, it can be convenient to make use of the &#39;use&#39; function within the REPL as a way to include your project within the user namespace.  Being in the user namespace gives you access to the REPL tools (eg. doc, source, etc)\nExample\nLets make use of the use function to include a library called really-useful-code.core\n(use &#39;really-useful-code.core)\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };

This should be pulled into this workshop into its own section\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"development-environment/other-tools.html":{"url":"development-environment/other-tools.html","title":"Other tools","body":"Other Development tools for Clojure\nClojure runs on the Java Virtual Machine so its not surprising that there is good support for Clojure in the major Java IDEs.\nEclipse\nCounterclockwise\nInteliJ\n\nCursive is a Clojure IDE that aims to understands your code.  Advanced structural editing, refactorings, VCS integration and much more, all out of the box.  It is currently a standalone tool, although will eventually become an IntelliJ plugin.\nLa Clojure is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.  Provides Clojure language support: syntax and error highlighting, completion, navigation and refactorings.\nNetbeans\nNetbeans did have great support for Clojure, but unfortunately at the time of writing the Clojure plugin has been unmaintained for so long it is not a viable tool to use for Cojure development.\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "}}}
